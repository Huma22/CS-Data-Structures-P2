Inner peace is really important to the human mind. I realized it a few years back only. I wanna share my experience with this component. I entirely depended on my father's decisions, and I don't even know what I should buy for myself. All of my friends went to different colleges, and my father was given two choices: either you wanna go to the US or do medicine in india. That was a hard decision to take by myself, and I studied my father's choices, I felt both the same advantages and disadvantages. And I left that choice to my father, at that time, I literally felt like Why i'm living in this world. I don't know how to make my own life choices. I shared my guilt and feelings with my family, and my mother suggested if you alone, then automatically, you will start believing in yourself. So, I thought it was a good idea, and I applied for different medical colleges. I got acceptance from UIC college of engineering but not medical, cause i didn't do pre-med. Being unconfident of my choices for a long time, I kept a few other choices. So, everything I did was keep making choices, and I didn't believe in myself. My father saw my struggles and all, he took the move, and he sent me to the US.
For a few days, I stayed with my family in the US. Once they left me alone, everything became difficult, and the major I took became hectic to me, and again I cried with my family. I can't stay like this till the end. I went into depression. And my father took me to isha foundation, where i learned what mental peace is, and how to keep myself confident. Sadhguru is a beautiful person who taught me how to stay concentrated and how to take failures. But at that he became my teacher and I shared everything with him, I felt really good when I saw changes in me. I chose this topic because everyone might come through some difficulties, but the mentally ill can destroy everything in their life.
