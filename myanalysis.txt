The big-O analysis for the buildmap in my program is O(log n) as we are reading n number of elements and pushing them into vectors and maps but it might be O(N) as well as if i calculate using the loops in the function as i only used 2 while loops, I thought that the big O for the print map might be O(log n) for as we are accessing elements from a map, and at first i thought the big O for my generate text might be O(n^2) but looking at the loops and calculating, i thought it has to be O(n) as i was accessing elements with the help of for loops and while loops, and as I am not sure if weather the arrow operator affects the big O of my program in anyway I did not take that into account.
